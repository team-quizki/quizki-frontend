# Quizki Frontend
Quizki is a question and answer database which generates exams. This is the frontend of the project. For the backend go to [team-quizki/backend](https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-backend).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) version 6.0.1.

## Getting Started
Here is what you need to do to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependencies
To run the frontend you will need the following tools
* [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
* Angular Command Line Interface ([Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/))
You can use Node Package Manager (npm) to install AngularCLI.

### Installation
To get the frontend running on your local machine follow these steps.
  1. Clone this repository. `$ git clone https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-frontend.git`
  2. Change to the quizki-frontend directory. `$ cd quizki-frontend`
  3. Run npm install to install pacages and dependencies required by this Angular project `$ npm install`

If the above steps worked, you should be ready to sereve the app.

## Development Server
Run `$ ng serve` for a dev server, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You can also run `$ ng serve --open` to serve the app and open it in a new browser tab automatically. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If `$ ng serve` is not working run `$ npm link`, and then run `$ ng serve` again.

## Code Scaffolding
Run `$ ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `$ ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `$ ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running the Tests
We have a couple simple tests built.

### Running unit tests
Run `$ ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
Run `$ ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further Help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `$ ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Deployment
The project is not yet ready for deployment. We will add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system when it is ready.

## Built With
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
